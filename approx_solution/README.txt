| How to run our approximate solution |
=======================================

1. Navigate to the approx_solution directory
   
   cd np-project/approx_solution
   


2. Run test cases

   bash run_examples.sh 26 7

   IMPORTANT: Use the same parameters you used to generate and run tests for the exact solution
   In our case, we used 26 and 7



3. Check your output

    The times to run each test can be found in the current directory
    approx_solution/times.txt

    The solutions to each test case can be found within the test_cases directory
    test_cases/expectedOutput.txt
